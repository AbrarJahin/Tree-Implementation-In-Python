Project Run Command-
--------------------

First, you need to go to the code directorey (for me it was `D:\Education\2. Algorithm\Project\FinalProject`)

```
cd "D:\Education\2. Algorithm\Project\FinalProject"
```

Command for running first program-
```
python Program1.py 0 input1.txt
```

Command for running second program-

```
python Program2.py 0 input1.txt
```

There are 2 things in the command line argument.

1. Choices (Can be found in [here](#Project-with-these-4-options))
2. Input File Location

# Project with these 4 options

0. HashTable
1. BST
2. SplayTree
3. SkipList
4. RBTree

These 4 algorithms are implemented here and data inputs are read from text file.

Project requirements can be found in [here](./Requirements.pdf).

# Output-
---------

## For program 1

If it runs, then for all trees (1, 2 and 4) the first block will show sorted elements, the second block will show the tree, the third block will show the whole data-structure and last block will show the runtime.
For option 0 and 3, the first block will show the data structure and the second block will show the runtime.

## For program 2
If it runs, then the first block will show the height of the tree after each operation and the second block will show the runtime.
